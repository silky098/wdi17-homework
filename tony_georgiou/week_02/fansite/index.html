    <p>The word is out in the corridors and classrooms of General Assembly's offices in York Street, Sydney that Joel Turnball, one of GA's senior teachers has a clandestine crush on the late Grace Hopper. Rumours abound as to how this admiration of the Rear Admiral began. Was it their mutual love of all things techy, or their entwined hatred for things that float - Grace could not bear the sight of a sailing enemy vessel, and Joel has a bitter disgust for the commonly flawed use of the "float" property in CSS?</p>

    <p>Insiders say it's their shared passion for those tiny, gentle creatures of the order of lepidoptera - Joel's love of butterflies is well known, and Grace's fondness for "debugging" moths from mainframe computers made her the originator of the phrase.</p>

    <h3>Something You Might Not Know</h3>

    <p>Grace preferred to wear socks rather than pantyhose as she found the latter cut into her jib.</p>
