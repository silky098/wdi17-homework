                "as i entered the cave, the bears looked up. knowing i wasn't an immediate threat, they fell back into their slumber. deep down, though, they knew why i was there. they knew what they took from me. 17 years later i had finally come back to retrieve my iphone charger.

                i draw pixel art with paper and ink and stuff, as well as digitally. i hope you like them.
