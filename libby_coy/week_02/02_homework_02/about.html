               "hi i am jennmoneydollars. i'm an artist in jersey city (on purpose) and an open web engineer at a cool company called bocoup. when i'm not building open web apps with the coolest folks in the game, i'm making art with code, telling jokes, and getting yelled at on the internet. my visual art has been described as "neon abstract pixel erotica" and my tech satire has been described as "your eyes are awful, like you are also awful".
               <br>
               <br>
               in a past life i was an engineer at the nba which stands for basketball and, before that, taught and evaluated computer science education at montclair state university â€“ where I got my bs and ms in computer science. i'm the founder/organizer of jerseyscript, a front-end developer meetup based in nj, and i co-emcee the world-renowned and bespoke kale-loving brooklyn js!"
