<!-- In 1986 she had a conversation with David Letterman about pantyhose

When she was 7, she decided to learn how an alarm clock worked, and so she took apart 7 alarm clocks until her mother figured out what she was fdoing and took away 6

She often carried around pieces of wire that represented the maximum distance that electricity could travel in a billionth of a second - 11.8 inches long. a microsecond is 984 feet-->
